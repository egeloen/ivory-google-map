# UPGRADE

### 0.9.1 to 1.0.0

 * The `MapHelper` constructor now takes an `ApiHelper` as first argument (all the other parameters have been moved
   forward).

### 0.9.0 to 0.9.1

 * All helpers classes have been refactored in order to generate a JS container by map.
 * The `TemplatingException` has been renamed to `HelperException` to be consistent with the namespace.
