# Installation

To install the Ivory Google Map library, you will need [Composer](http://getcomposer.org). It's a PHP 5.3+ dependency
manager which allows you to declare the dependent libraries your project needs and it will install & autoload them for
you.

## Set up Composer

Composer comes with a simple phar file. To easily access it from anywhere on your system, you can execute:

```
$ curl -s https://getcomposer.org/installer | php
$ sudo mv composer.phar /usr/local/bin/composer
```

## Define dependencies

### Mandatories dependencies

Create a ``composer.json`` file at the root directory of your project and simply require the
``egeloen/google-map`` package:

```
{
    "require": {
        "egeloen/google-map": "dev-master"
    }
}
```

### Optional dependencies

If you want to use Geocoding stuff, you will need [Geocoder](http://github.com/willdurand/Geocoder):

```
{
    "require": {
        "willdurand/geocoder": "*"
    }
}
```

If you want to use Directions or Distance Matrix stuff, you will need an
[http adapter](http://github.com/widop/http-adapter):

```
{
    "require": {
        "widop/http-adapter": "1.0.*"
    }
}
```

## Install dependencies

Now, you have define your dependencies, you can install them:

```
$ composer install
```

Composer will automatically download your dependencies & create an autoload file in the ``vendor`` directory.

## Autoload

So easy, you just have to require the generated autoload file and you are already ready to play:

``` php
<?php

require __DIR__.'/vendor/autoload.php';

use Ivory\GoogleMap;

// ...
```

The Ivory Google Map library follows the [PSR-0 Standard](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-0.md).
If you prefer install it manually, it can be autoload by any convenient autoloader.
