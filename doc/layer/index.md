# Layers

Layers are objects on the map that consist of one or more separate items, but are manipulated as a single unit. Layers 
generally reflect collections of objects that you add on top of the map to designate a common association. . Layers may 
also alter the presentation layer of the map itself, slightly altering the base tiles in a fashion consistent with the 
layer.
