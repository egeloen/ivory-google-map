# Controls

The maps on Google Maps contain UI elements for allowing user interaction through the map. These elements are known as
`controls` and you can include variations of these controls in your Google Maps API application. Alternatively, you
can do nothing and let the Google Maps API handle all control behavior.

The controls bag is accessible via:

``` php
$controls = $map->getControls();
```
